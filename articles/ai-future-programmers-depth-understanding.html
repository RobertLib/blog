<!-- title: AI Will Raise the Bar for Programmers -->
<!-- date: 2025-11-22 -->
<!-- description: Why AI demands deeper understanding from developers - exploring how artificial intelligence shifts our focus from mechanical coding to system architecture. -->

<p>
  There's a common misconception floating around, especially among non-technical
  people: AI will replace programmers because it can generate code. You can ask
  ChatGPT to "create a todo app," and boom, you get working code. So why would
  we need developers in the future, right?
</p>

<p>
  This couldn't be further from the truth. In fact, I believe AI will have the
  opposite effect, it will demand that future programmers understand things
  <strong>more deeply</strong>, not less. Let me explain why.
</p>

<h2>The Difference Between Coders and Developers</h2>

<p>
  First, we need to distinguish between two types of people working with code:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>The Coder</strong> - Someone who mechanically implements
    specifications, writes lines of code without much thought, essentially
    acting as a human code generator
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>The Developer</strong> - Someone whose expertise lies in
    understanding how things work, designing architecture, and ensuring code and
    projects remain maintainable long-term
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  Here's the crucial insight:
  <strong>The first group is indeed at risk.</strong>
  If your job is purely mechanical code production, AI can already do that
  better and faster. But for the second group, real developers, AI is not a
  threat. It's a powerful accelerator.
</p>

<h2>The Todo App Illusion</h2>

<p>
  When someone sees AI generate a todo app perfectly, they think programming is
  solved. But this reveals a fundamental misunderstanding of what software
  development actually is.
</p>

<p>
  A simple example application is not a real-world application. Real projects
  have:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Quality requirements</strong> - Code standards, review processes
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Maintainability concerns</strong> - Will this be understandable in a
    year?
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Testing needs</strong> - Unit tests, integration tests, E2E tests
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>User experience demands</strong> - Accessibility, performance,
    responsiveness
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Operational complexity</strong> - Deployment, monitoring, scaling
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Sound architecture</strong> - Modularity, separation of concerns
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Business logic translation</strong> - Understanding what the client
    actually needs
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  AI can generate a todo app. But can it design a scalable architecture for a
  system with millions of users? Can it make informed decisions about database
  optimization under heavy load? Can it translate vague business requirements
  into working software? Can it balance technical debt against delivery
  pressure?
</p>

<p>
  <strong>No.</strong> These require deep understanding, experience, and
  judgment that AI doesn't possess.
</p>

<h2>The Rising Bar of Expectations</h2>

<p>
  Here's something interesting: as technology advances, our standards keep
  rising. Twenty years ago, a website that loaded in 5 seconds was fine. Today,
  users expect sub-second load times. We expect perfect mobile responsiveness,
  accessibility compliance, security by default, and seamless user experiences.
</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>
    "The bar for what constitutes 'good software' keeps rising, and AI just
    raises it further."
  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
  AI might make it easier to write initial code, but client expectations and
  project complexity are growing faster than AI capabilities. The gap between
  "works on my machine" and "production-ready system" is actually widening, not
  shrinking.
</p>

<h2>Liberation from the Mundane</h2>

<p>
  This is actually <strong>good news</strong> for developers who embrace
  learning. AI handling the mechanical parts of programming frees us to focus on
  what actually matters:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Architecture design</strong> - How should components interact for
    optimal maintainability?
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Business logic</strong> - What does the client really need, beyond
    what they asked for?
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Performance optimization</strong> - Where are the bottlenecks and
    how do we fix them?
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Database design</strong> - How do we structure data for current and
    future needs?
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>System reliability</strong> - How do we handle failures gracefully?
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Security considerations</strong> - What could go wrong and how do we
    prevent it?
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  In the past, we spent 80% of our time writing boilerplate code and 20%
  thinking about architecture. AI can flip that ratio. Now we can spend 80% of
  our time on the hard problems that actually deliver value.
</p>

<h2>AI as an Accelerated Learning Tool</h2>

<p>
  There's another crucial aspect: AI doesn't just help you code faster, it helps
  you <strong>learn faster</strong>. When you're working with a new technology,
  AI can explain concepts, show examples, and help you understand patterns
  quickly.
</p>

<p>
  For developers committed to continuous learning, this is transformative. You
  can dive deeper into topics, explore more technologies, and build a broader
  and deeper understanding than was previously possible. The limiting factor is
  no longer access to information, it's your willingness to learn.
</p>

<h3>But This Requires Active Learning</h3>

<p>
  Here's the critical point: you can't just copy-paste AI-generated code without
  understanding it. If you do, you're basically a glorified code executor, and
  yes, that role will disappear.
</p>

<p>
  But if you use AI as a tool to understand <em>why</em> code works the way it
  does, to explore different approaches, to learn new patterns, then you're
  actually deepening your expertise, not replacing it.
</p>

<h2>Higher Standards for Future Developers</h2>

<p>
  This brings me to my main thesis:
  <strong
    >future programmers will need to understand things more deeply, not
    less</strong
  >.
</p>

<p>
  When coding becomes easier, the competitive advantage shifts to understanding:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Understanding complex systems and their interactions</li>
  <li>Understanding business domains and user needs</li>
  <li>Understanding performance characteristics and trade-offs</li>
  <li>Understanding security implications and risks</li>
  <li>Understanding team dynamics and communication</li>
</ul>

<p>
  The developers who thrive in an AI-enabled world won't be those who write the
  most code, they'll be those who make the best decisions about what code to
  write and how to structure it.
</p>

<h2>The Accountability Factor: Why Clients Need Humans</h2>

<p>
  There's another crucial aspect that often gets overlooked in discussions about
  AI replacing developers: <strong>accountability and responsibility</strong>.
</p>

<p>
  When clients hire a development team or a software company, they're not just
  buying code. They're delegating responsibility for a critical business
  function because they don't want to, or can't, handle it themselves. They
  need:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Someone to be accountable</strong> - A person or team responsible
    for outcomes
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Legal guarantees</strong> - Contracts, warranties, and liability
    coverage
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Professional responsibility</strong> - Meeting requirements and
    quality standards
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Problem ownership</strong> - Someone who fixes issues when they
    arise
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Long-term support</strong> - Maintenance, updates, and evolution of
    the system
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  <strong>AI cannot provide any of this.</strong> You can't sue ChatGPT when
  your application fails. You can't hold GitHub Copilot accountable for a
  security breach. You can't demand that Claude fix bugs in production at 3 AM.
</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>
    "Clients aren't just buying code, they're buying accountability,
    responsibility, and peace of mind."
  </p>
</blockquote>

<h3>The Legal and Business Reality</h3>

<p>
  From a legal and business perspective, AI will never be able to replace the
  human element in professional software development. Companies need:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Someone to sign contracts with</li>
  <li>Someone to take legal responsibility for deliverables</li>
  <li>Someone to guarantee quality and timelines</li>
  <li>Someone who can be held accountable when things go wrong</li>
  <li>
    Someone who understands their business and can translate needs into
    solutions
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  If your role as a developer is purely to type code with zero accountability
  for the outcome, then yes, that position might be at risk. But if you're
  someone who takes ownership of projects, understands client needs, guarantees
  quality, and stands behind your work, AI can't replace that.
</p>

<p>
  In fact, as AI handles more of the mechanical coding, the
  <em>human responsibility aspect</em> becomes even more valuable. Clients will
  pay premium rates for developers and teams they can trust to deliver, support,
  and be accountable for their systems.
</p>

<h2>The Risk of Stagnation</h2>

<p>
  There is a real risk, though: <strong>developers who stop learning</strong>.
  If you become complacent, relying entirely on AI without understanding the
  underlying principles, you're making yourself obsolete.
</p>

<p>
  This is similar to how calculators didn't eliminate mathematicians, they
  eliminated people who could only do arithmetic. The mathematicians who
  understood the deeper concepts became more valuable, not less.
</p>

<p>
  The same will happen with programming. Those who understand computer science
  fundamentals, software architecture, system design, and business logic will
  become more valuable. Those who only knew how to type syntax will find their
  skills commoditized.
</p>

<h2>Practical Advice for Developers</h2>

<p>So what should developers do to prepare for this future?</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <strong>Focus on fundamentals</strong> - Understand algorithms, data
    structures, networking, databases at a deep level
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Learn system design</strong> - Study how large-scale systems are
    architected and why
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Understand business</strong> - Learn to translate business needs
    into technical solutions
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Master debugging</strong> - Get good at finding and fixing problems
    in complex systems
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Practice architecture</strong> - Design systems, not just write code
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Communicate effectively</strong> - Learn to explain technical
    concepts to non-technical people
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Never stop learning</strong> - Explore new technologies, patterns,
    and approaches constantly
  </li>
</ol>

<p>
  Most importantly:
  <strong>use AI as a learning tool, not a replacement for thinking</strong>.
  When AI generates code, understand it. Question it. Improve it. Use it as a
  starting point for deeper exploration, not as a final answer.
</p>

<h2>The Bottom Line</h2>

<p>
  Will AI take jobs from programmers? Yes, from those who are just code writers.
  But for those who are true developers, problem solvers, architects, and
  lifelong learners, AI is not a threat. It's the most powerful tool we've ever
  had.
</p>

<p>
  The future doesn't belong to people who can type syntax quickly. It belongs to
  people who understand systems deeply, who can make good architectural
  decisions, who can translate business needs into technical reality, and who
  never stop learning.
</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>
    "AI won't replace developers. It will separate developers who understand
    their craft from those who were just typing code all along."
  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
  So no, future programmers won't understand less. They'll need to understand
  <strong>more</strong>, more about architecture, more about systems, more about
  business, more about the bigger picture. And that's exactly why this AI
  revolution is so exciting for those of us committed to the craft.
