<!-- title: Social Media Algorithms: Threat to Democracy -->

<!-- description: How social media algorithms influence thinking, shape political opinions, and pose a significant threat to democratic processes and informed civic discourse. -->

<p>
  When I built
  <a href="https://www.watch-list.me/" target="_blank">Watch-List.me</a>, one of
  my main motivations was to create an environment where I could browse
  streaming platform content without algorithmic influence. I wanted the ability
  to discover movies and shows organically, without someone dictating what I
  should watch based on my previous behavior. This seemingly simple desire led
  me to contemplate a much more fundamental problem of our time.
</p>

<h2>Algorithms as the New Reality</h2>

<p>
  People today spend several hours daily on social media platforms. For many,
  these have become practically a second reality, and for some, even the first.
  This isn't just a statistic, it's a fundamental shift in how we perceive the
  world around us. Instead of natural stimuli from all sides and angles,
  algorithms now curate our daily information intake.
</p>

<p>
  Humans should naturally evolve through diverse stimuli, confrontation with
  different opinions, and gradual formation of their own worldview. But what
  happens when algorithms take over this process? They gain control over what we
  listen to, what we watch, and most importantly, how we think.
</p>

<h2>From Entertainment to Political Manipulation</h2>

<p>
  You might think it's not that serious, an algorithm recommends movies or music
  based on my taste. The problem becomes visible when the same mechanism is
  applied to political and social opinions. Algorithms don't distinguish between
  recommending a TV series and recommending political content.
</p>

<p>
  The worst-case scenario is when algorithms are used for targeted manipulation
  of voting behavior. When people with such algorithmically-shaped opinions go
  to vote, they can influence democratic processes in ways they never originally
  intended. Democracy relies on the assumption that voters have access to
  diverse information and can make free decisions.
</p>

<h2>Intent or Side Effect?</h2>

<p>
  I'm not sure to what extent manipulation is the intent of every social media
  platform. Perhaps it's just a side effect of trying to attract users to
  content and profit from data and advertising. Or perhaps some authoritarian
  regimes deliberately manipulate the public in ways that suit their own
  political interests.
</p>

<p>
  I don't know how it really works and probably never will. But I operate from a
  simple principle: if such a possibility exists and is technically feasible,
  someone will definitely use it. Human history teaches us that powerful tools
  are sooner or later abused.
</p>

<h2>Conspiracy Theories as the Gateway</h2>

<p>
  An interesting phenomenon is the role of conspiracy theories in this system. I
  don't see anything inherently harmful when someone occasionally reads or
  watches a documentary about some mystery explained through fantastic,
  scientifically unfounded evidence. They can be fascinating and entertaining.
</p>

<p>
  What's harmful is when people use such unverified theories and manipulations
  to form their overall opinion about society, their country, and politics.
  Algorithms tend to deepen radicalization, once you click on conspiratorial
  content, you'll likely be recommended similar content over and over again.
</p>

<h2>What Can We Do About It?</h2>

<p>
  The first step is awareness of the problem. We must admit that algorithms
  influence us more than we think. The second step is active protection against
  manipulation:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Disable personalization</strong> in social media account settings so
    algorithms have less data for content targeting
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Diversify information sources</strong>, read media with different
    political orientations
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Critically verify information</strong> from multiple independent
    sources
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Consciously seek opposing views</strong> to those we agree with
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Limit time on social media</strong> and spend more time in the real
    world
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Conclusion: A Warning Against Digital Manipulation</h2>

<p>
  I think we should be extremely careful about social media algorithms. It's not
  just about what movie we watch, it's about how we perceive the world, how we
  make decisions, and ultimately about what our democracy looks like.
</p>

<p>
  The Watch-List.me project wasn't just about watching movies without
  algorithms. It was an experiment in what it would look like if we took back
  control over what we consume. And I believe we should approach our entire
  digital life in a similar way.
</p>

<p>
  Algorithms are a powerful tool. It's up to us not to let them control us, but
  to learn to live with them in a way that protects our ability to think freely
  and make decisions.
