<!-- description: How to choose the right tech stack for each project - when to use HTML, static generators, frameworks, or separated backends with practical guidance and tips. -->

<p>
  In today's world of web technologies, we face a paradox of choice. We have
  countless frameworks, libraries, and tools at our disposal, but this can be
  our biggest problem. I often see projects where developers used Next.js for a
  simple landing page or plain React for a complex application with
  authentication. The key to success is spending enough time choosing the right
  technology at the beginning.
</p>

<h2>Profile Page: HTML + CSS + JavaScript</h2>

<p>
  Let's start with the simplest case. Do you need to create a personal portfolio
  or company presentation? <strong>You don't need any framework.</strong>
  Plain HTML, CSS, and a bit of JavaScript for interactivity is enough.
</p>

<p>Advantages of this approach:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Loading speed</strong> - no additional libraries</li>
  <li>
    <strong>SEO optimization</strong> - everything is in HTML from the start
  </li>
  <li><strong>Deployment simplicity</strong> - upload anywhere</li>
  <li><strong>Zero dependencies</strong> - no build process needed</li>
</ul>

<p>
  If your website has fewer than 10 pages and primarily presents information, a
  framework will only bring unnecessary complexity. I often see developers who
  set up an entire React project with Webpack configuration for a simple landing
  page. That's like using an excavator to dig a hole for a tree.
</p>

<h2>Blog: Static Generator Instead of Server</h2>

<p>
  For a blog like this one, you have two reasonable options: server-side
  rendering or static generator.
  <strong>Static generator is almost always the better choice.</strong>
</p>

<p>Why static generator wins:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Performance</strong> - HTML files are served directly from CDN
  </li>
  <li><strong>Security</strong> - no database, no security vulnerabilities</li>
  <li><strong>Cost</strong> - hosting static files is almost free</li>
  <li><strong>Scalability</strong> - can handle millions of visitors</li>
</ul>

<p>
  This blog is built on a custom static generator in Node.js. I write articles
  in HTML, the generator compiles them into final pages, and I upload them to
  GitHub Pages. The entire build process takes seconds, the website loads
  lightning-fast, and never crashes.
</p>

<pre><code>// Example of a simple generator
const fs = require('fs');
const path = require('path');

function generateBlog() {
  const articles = loadArticles();
  const template = loadTemplate();

  articles.forEach(article => {
    const html = template.replace('{{content}}', article.content);
    fs.writeFileSync(`dist/${article.slug}.html`, html);
  });
}
</code></pre>

<h2>Admin/CMS: API + React Frontend</h2>

<p>
  When you need an admin interface or content management system, we're getting
  into an area where a framework makes sense.
  <strong>Separated backend (API) + React frontend</strong> is a proven choice.
</p>

<p>Why this approach works:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Clear separation</strong> - backend handles data, frontend handles
    UI
  </li>
  <li><strong>Flexibility</strong> - you can replace either layer</li>
  <li><strong>Testability</strong> - each layer is tested separately</li>
  <li><strong>Scalability</strong> - you can scale parts independently</li>
</ul>

<p>
  For the backend, you can use Node.js with Express, Python with Django/FastAPI,
  or any other stack. The frontend as a Single Page Application in React handles
  the user interface. This solution is ideal for internal tools, dashboards, and
  content management.
</p>

<h2>Hybrid Applications: Next.js as the Golden Middle Path</h2>

<p>
  Choose Next.js when you
  <strong
    >need to combine the advantages of server-side rendering with an interactive
    frontend</strong
  >
  and want to have everything in one project.
</p>

<p>When Next.js is the right choice:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>E-commerce</strong> - you need both SEO and interactivity</li>
  <li><strong>Marketing websites</strong> - with forms and dynamic content</li>
  <li>
    <strong>Applications with authentication</strong> - where you need to
    protect API keys
  </li>
  <li><strong>Smaller teams</strong> - one project, one technology</li>
</ul>

<p>
  Next.js allows you to server-side render pages for SEO while having fully
  interactive parts of the application. You can also securely hide API keys in
  server-side code. It's a compromise between simplicity and functionality.
</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>
    "Next.js is like a Swiss Army knife - it can do a lot, but it's not the best
    at any specific area. Sometimes that's exactly what you need."
  </p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Large Applications: Separated Backend + React SPA</h2>

<p>
  For large applications with complex logic, hybrid solutions become
  problematic.
  <strong
    >For enterprise applications, choose clearly separated backend and React SPA
    built into static files.</strong
  >
</p>

<p>Why separation wins for large projects:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Clear responsibility</strong> - backend and frontend teams can work
    independently
  </li>
  <li><strong>Scalability</strong> - each layer scales according to needs</li>
  <li><strong>Technology independence</strong> - you can replace any layer</li>
  <li><strong>Easy testing</strong> - each layer has its own tests</li>
</ul>

<p>
  React SPA built into static files can be hosted on CDN, which is fast and
  cheap. If the application is behind authentication, you don't need to worry
  about SEO, so server-side rendering is unnecessary. The backend handles API,
  authentication, and business logic.
</p>

<h2>Decision Tree: What to Choose?</h2>

<p>Here's a practical guide on how to decide:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <strong>Do you have less than 10 pages without complex logic?</strong><br />
    → HTML + CSS + JavaScript
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Do you need a blog or documentation?</strong><br />
    → Static generator (Gatsby, Next.js static export, custom)
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Are you building an admin interface or CMS?</strong><br />
    → API backend + React SPA
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Do you need SEO + interactivity + protect API keys?</strong><br />
    → Next.js (hybrid solution)
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Are you building a large application with complex logic?</strong
    ><br />
    → Separated backend + React SPA
  </li>
</ol>

<h2>Common Mistakes When Choosing Technology</h2>

<p>From experience, I see several recurring mistakes:</p>

<h3>1. Overkill for Simple Projects</h3>
<p>
  Using React for a static presentation is like hiring a symphony orchestra to
  play "Happy Birthday". It works, but it's unnecessarily complex.
</p>

<h3>2. Underestimating Complexity</h3>
<p>
  Conversely, trying to build a complex e-commerce site with only vanilla
  JavaScript is a recipe for endless maintainability problems.
</p>

<h3>3. Chasing Trends</h3>
<p>
  Just because something is new and trendy doesn't mean it's suitable for your
  project. Choose technologies based on requirements, not Hacker News.
</p>

<h3>4. Lack of Planning Time</h3>
<p>
  The most common mistake is rushing the technology choice. Spend enough time on
  this at the beginning - changing it later will be exponentially more
  expensive.
</p>

<h2>Conclusion: Less Often Means More</h2>

<p>
  Today, we often think that more complex technology automatically means a
  better solution. The opposite is true.
  <strong
    >The best technology is the simplest one that meets your
    requirements.</strong
  >
</p>

<p>Before every project, ask yourself these questions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>What exactly do we need to build?</li>
  <li>Who will use the application and how?</li>
  <li>What are our performance and scalability requirements?</li>
  <li>How big is the team and what experience do they have?</li>
  <li>What is the time and financial budget?</li>
</ul>

<p>
  The answers to these questions will give you clear guidance for choosing
  technology. Remember: a successful project isn't one that uses the latest
  technologies, but one that solves real user problems effectively and
  sustainably.
</p>

<p>
  Technologies are just tools. Their value is measured by how well they help you
  achieve your goals, not by how modern or popular they are.
