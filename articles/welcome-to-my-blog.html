<!-- description: Join my journey through web development focused on simple, pragmatic solutions and effective web applications without the hype - practical insights and tips. -->

<p>
  Welcome to my blog! My name is Robert and I've been working in web development
  for several years. I decided to start this blog to share my experiences and
  opinions about the world of web technologies.
</p>

<h2>What I'll Write About</h2>

<p>I'll mainly focus on:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Frontend development</strong> - JavaScript, CSS, HTML and related
    technologies
  </li>
  <li><strong>Backend development</strong> - Node.js, databases, API design</li>
  <li><strong>Simple and pragmatic approaches</strong> to solving problems</li>
  <li>
    <strong>Critical perspective</strong> on hype and unnecessarily complex
    solutions
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Why Simplicity?</h2>

<p>
  In today's world of JavaScript technologies, I often encounter excessive
  complexity. New frameworks, build tools, and abstractions emerge every day,
  but they don't always bring real value. I'd like to show that often less is
  enough, and simpler solutions can be much more effective.

    there is nothing left to take away." - Antoine de Saint-Exup√©ry

<h2>What You Can Expect</h2>

<p>
  I'll try to write practical articles with concrete code examples. I won't shy
  away from controversial topics - if I think some trend is overblown or
  unnecessary, I'll write about it openly.
</p>

<p>
  My goal isn't to offend anyone, but rather to spark healthy discussion about
  how to do web development better, more efficiently, and with less complexity.
</p>

<p>Looking forward to our journey through the world of web technologies!</p>
