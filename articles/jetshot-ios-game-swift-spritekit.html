<!-- description: Creating a 2D arcade shooter for iOS using Swift and SpriteKit. Exploring native development, procedurally generated levels, and vector-based graphics. -->

<p>
  I'm excited to introduce my latest project -
  <a
    href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/jetshot/id6754814450"
    target="_blank"
    rel="noopener"
    >Jetshot</a
  >, a 2D arcade shooter for iOS. This project gave me the opportunity to dive
  deep into native iOS game development and explore the powerful yet
  underappreciated SpriteKit framework.
</p>

<p>
  Jetshot is a free arcade shooter with gradually increasing difficulty,
  designed to provide quick entertainment sessions without consuming too much of
  your time. If you have an iOS device, I'd be thrilled if you'd try it out and
  leave a rating on the App Store!
</p>

<h2>Why Swift for Game Development?</h2>

<p>
  When I decided to develop a game specifically for iOS, Swift was an obvious
  choice. As a compiled language with modern features and clean syntax, Swift
  makes game development surprisingly enjoyable. The language provides:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Modern language features</strong> - Protocol-oriented programming,
    generics, and powerful type safety
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Excellent performance</strong> - Compiled code runs efficiently on
    iOS devices
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Clean syntax</strong> - Less boilerplate compared to Objective-C,
    making game logic readable
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>First-class iOS integration</strong> - Seamless access to all iOS
    frameworks and features
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  Unfortunately, Swift's tight coupling with the iOS ecosystem means it's rarely
  used for game development in the broader industry. Most game developers prefer
  cross-platform solutions like Unity or Unreal Engine to reach multiple
  platforms simultaneously. However, since Jetshot was specifically targeted at
  iOS, working with Swift was a fantastic experience without the compromises
  that cross-platform frameworks often require.
</p>

<h2>SpriteKit: Apple's Hidden Gem</h2>

<p>
  For the game framework, I chose SpriteKit - Apple's 2D game development
  framework. SpriteKit is an excellent piece of technology that deserves more
  recognition than it gets. It provides:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Tree-based object structure</strong> - Clean scene graph hierarchy
    for organizing game objects
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Rich action system</strong> - Animations and movements with
    declarative, easy-to-use APIs
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Scene management</strong> - Seamless transitions between different
    game screens
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Built-in physics</strong> - 2D physics engine ready to use out of
    the box
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Declarative approach</strong> - Many common game development tasks
    handled elegantly
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  The framework works declaratively and takes care of many common game
  development concerns, allowing developers to focus on game logic rather than
  low-level rendering details.
</p>

<h2>The Unfortunate Fate of Great Technology</h2>

<p>
  Sadly, SpriteKit is no longer actively developed by Apple. This situation
  reminds me of Microsoft's XNA framework - another excellent game development
  technology that was eventually abandoned. XNA found new life through the
  open-source community as MonoGame, but SpriteKit likely won't have the same
  fortune due to its limited popularity and reach.
</p>

<p>
  It's a real shame because SpriteKit is genuinely superb technology, especially
  for mobile 2D games. The framework strikes an excellent balance between power
  and ease of use, making it possible to create polished 2D games efficiently.
  Its eventual obsolescence feels like a waste of great engineering.
</p>

<h2>A Sprite-less Game in SpriteKit</h2>

<p>
  Here's an interesting paradox: despite its name suggesting sprite-based
  graphics, Jetshot doesn't use a single sprite. Instead, I took a different
  approach - all graphics are defined programmatically using vector-based
  rendering, similar to how SVG works on the web.
</p>

<p>This approach offers several advantages:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Code-driven control</strong> - Everything is directly controllable
    through code
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Perfect scalability</strong> - Graphics remain sharp on any screen
    size or resolution
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Easy modifications</strong> - Visual changes don't require asset
    pipeline updates
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Smaller app size</strong> - No image assets to bundle with the
    application
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  This programmatic approach means I can define shapes, colors, and animations
  entirely in code. The result is crisp, resolution-independent graphics that
  look perfect on any iPhone display, from older models to the latest Pro Max
  screens.
</p>

<h2>Procedural Level Generation</h2>

<p>
  Another key aspect of Jetshot is its procedurally generated levels. Rather
  than hand-crafting each level or using a visual editor, I define levels
  through data configurations. As a programmer, this approach feels natural and
  powerful:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Data-driven design</strong> - Levels are defined as configuration
    data
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Dynamic assembly</strong> - The game constructs levels at runtime
    from these configurations
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Easy iteration</strong> - Tweaking level design is just a matter of
    adjusting data
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Consistency</strong> - Algorithmic generation ensures consistent
    difficulty curves
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  This approach doesn't suit every game genre, but for an arcade shooter like
  Jetshot, it works perfectly. The data-driven level system allows for quick
  iteration and ensures that the difficulty progression feels balanced and fair.
</p>

<h2>The Developer Workflow Benefits</h2>

<p>
  Working directly in Swift and SpriteKit for iOS development provided several
  workflow benefits that cross-platform tools can't match:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Direct access to iOS features</strong> - No wrapper layers or
    plugins needed
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Excellent Xcode integration</strong> - First-class debugging and
    profiling tools
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Immediate testing</strong> - Run directly on device or simulator
    without export steps
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Optimal performance</strong> - Native code runs without
    cross-platform overhead
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  The tight integration between Swift, SpriteKit, and Xcode creates a smooth
  development experience. When you're not fighting with build systems or dealing
  with platform abstraction layers, you can focus entirely on making your game
  fun.
</p>

  and give it a try. Your ratings and feedback on the App Store would mean a lot
  and help others discover the game!
</p>

<h2>Reflections on Native iOS Game Development</h2>

<p>
  Building Jetshot reinforced my appreciation for platform-specific development.
  While cross-platform tools have their place and are often the pragmatic
  choice, there's something special about working directly with native
  technologies. You get closer to the metal, have fewer layers of abstraction,
  and can leverage platform-specific features without workarounds.
</p>

<p>
  Swift and SpriteKit may not be the standard choice for game development, but
  for iOS-specific projects, they offer an excellent development experience.
  It's unfortunate that SpriteKit's future is uncertain, but the framework
  remains a powerful tool for creating polished 2D games today.
</p>

<p>
  Thank you for reading, and I hope you enjoy playing Jetshot as much as I
  enjoyed creating it!
