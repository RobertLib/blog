<!-- title: AI Impact on Programming: Beyond the Hype -->
<!-- date: 2025-06-01 -->
<!-- description: A developer's honest perspective on how AI is changing programming - from code generation to economic impacts and the future of software development. -->

<p>
  We're living through one of the most significant shifts in programming since
  the invention of high-level languages. AI tools like GitHub Copilot, ChatGPT,
  and Claude are fundamentally changing how we write code. But beyond the
  marketing hype and breathless tech blog posts, what's really happening in the
  trenches?
</p>

<p>
  After using AI coding tools extensively in production work, I want to share an
  honest perspective on where we are and why I believe we're witnessing the
  formation of entirely new boundaries that will define the future of software
  development.
</p>

<h2>The Current Reality</h2>

<p>
  Let's start with what AI can actually do well today. These tools excel at:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Boilerplate generation</strong> - Writing repetitive code patterns
  </li>
  <li><strong>Code completion</strong> - Suggesting the next logical lines</li>
  <li>
    <strong>Simple transformations</strong> - Converting between formats or
    refactoring basic patterns
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Documentation</strong> - Explaining existing code or generating
    comments
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Learning acceleration</strong> - Helping developers understand new
    concepts quickly
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  These capabilities are genuinely useful. I've watched developers become
  noticeably more productive when generating CRUD operations, API endpoints, or
  configuration files. The time savings on routine tasks is real and measurable.
</p>

<h3>But Here's What's Missing</h3>

<p>
  However, AI struggles with the parts of programming that actually matter most:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>System design</strong> - Understanding how components should
    interact
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Business logic</strong> - Translating real-world requirements into
    code
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Performance optimization</strong> - Making informed tradeoffs based
    on constraints
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Debugging complex issues</strong> - Following the chain of causality
    in failures
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Code review</strong> - Evaluating whether solutions are maintainable
    long-term
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  In other words, AI is great at the mechanical aspects of programming but weak
  at the intellectual ones. And unfortunately, it's the intellectual work that
  delivers most of the value.
</p>

<h2>The Productivity Paradox</h2>

<p>
  Here's where things get interesting. While AI makes individual developers more
  productive at certain tasks, it's also changing the economics of software
  development in unexpected ways.
</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>
    "When everyone has access to the same productivity multiplier, competitive
    advantage shifts to other factors."
  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
  If every developer can generate boilerplate code instantly, then writing
  boilerplate code is no longer a differentiator. The value moves to areas where
  human judgment, creativity, and domain expertise still matter.
</p>

<h3>What This Means for Developers</h3>

<p>
  The skills that will become more valuable aren't necessarily the ones you'd
  expect:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>System thinking</strong> - Understanding how pieces fit together
  </li>
  <li><strong>Product sense</strong> - Knowing what to build and why</li>
  <li>
    <strong>Communication</strong> - Translating between technical and business
    stakeholders
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Critical evaluation</strong> - Knowing when AI suggestions are wrong
    or suboptimal
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Domain expertise</strong> - Deep knowledge of specific industries or
    problem spaces
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  Notice how many of these are "soft skills" that we've traditionally
  undervalued in engineering culture.
</p>

<h2>The Responsibility Question</h2>

<p>
  This brings me to something I think our industry isn't discussing enough:
  responsible AI adoption. Just because we can use AI for something doesn't mean
  we should.
</p>

<p>I've seen teams adopt AI tools without considering:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Code quality implications</strong> - What happens when everyone
    generates similar patterns?
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Learning impacts</strong> - Are junior developers missing
    fundamental experiences?
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Dependency risks</strong> - What if the AI service becomes
    unavailable or changes?
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Security concerns</strong> - How confident are we in AI-generated
    code security?
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  The rush to adopt AI reminds me of other technology hype cycles - lots of
  excitement, not enough critical thinking about long-term consequences.
</p>

<h3>A More Thoughtful Approach</h3>

<p>Instead of asking "How can we use AI for everything?", we should ask:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Where does AI genuinely improve outcomes?</li>
  <li>What are the risks we're accepting?</li>
  <li>How do we maintain code quality and team learning?</li>
  <li>What happens if we become too dependent on these tools?</li>
</ul>

<p>
  This isn't about being anti-AI - it's about being intentional rather than
  reactive.
</p>

<h2>The Economic Shift</h2>

<p>
  Perhaps the most significant change isn't technical but economic. AI is
  fundamentally altering the cost structure of software development.
</p>

<p>When basic coding tasks become nearly free, several things happen:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>More software gets built</strong> - Lower barriers mean more
    experimentation
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Quality becomes more important</strong> - Since quantity is easy,
    quality differentiates
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Maintenance costs dominate</strong> - Writing code is cheap,
    maintaining it isn't
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Human skills premium increases</strong> - The things only humans can
    do become more valuable
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  This suggests we're heading toward a world where the ability to generate code
  quickly matters less than the ability to generate the right code.
</p>

<h2>We're Forming New Boundaries</h2>

<p>
  What strikes me most about this moment in programming history is that we're
  not just adopting new tools - we're actively forming the boundaries that will
  define software development for years to come.
</p>

<p>
  There are no established limits yet. We're experimenting, pushing boundaries,
  and discovering what works and what doesn't. The decisions we make now about
  how to integrate AI into our workflows, what to automate and what to keep
  human, will shape the entire industry's future.
</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>
    "We're not just using AI - we're defining what programming will become."
  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
  This is both exciting and sobering. We have the opportunity to influence how
  this technology develops, but also the responsibility to consider the
  long-term implications of our choices.
</p>

<h2>Looking Forward</h2>

<p>
  Where does this leave us as developers? I think the answer is surprisingly
  optimistic.
</p>

<p>
  AI isn't replacing programmers - it's changing what programming means. We're
  moving from code writers to code curators. From implementers to architects.
  From typists to thinkers.
</p>

<p>The developers who will thrive are those who:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Use AI tools strategically rather than reflexively</li>
  <li>Focus on developing uniquely human skills</li>
  <li>Understand the business context of their technical decisions</li>
  <li>Can evaluate and improve AI-generated solutions</li>
  <li>Maintain curiosity about how things actually work</li>
  <li><strong>Actively participate in shaping these new boundaries</strong></li>
</ul>

<h2>The Bottom Line</h2>

<p>
  AI in programming is neither the revolution that optimists claim nor the
  threat that pessimists fear. It's a powerful tool that's changing the
  economics and practices of software development.
</p>

<p>
  But more importantly, we're at a unique moment in history where the boundaries
  of what programming will become are still being formed. We're not just
  adapting to change - we're creating it.
</p>

<p>
  The key is approaching it with the same critical thinking we apply to any new
  technology: understand its capabilities and limitations, consider the
  long-term implications, and use it intentionally rather than following the
  hype.
</p>

<p>
  Because ultimately, the goal isn't to write code faster - it's to build better
  software more effectively. And that's still fundamentally a human challenge,
  even as we're defining what "human" means in the context of AI-assisted
  development.
