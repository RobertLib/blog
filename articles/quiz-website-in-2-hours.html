<!-- description: Building a quiz website with AI agents - from idea to production deployment in just 2 hours using Claude Sonnet 4, rapid prototyping, and AI development. -->

<p>
  A few days ago, I had the idea to create a simple quiz website. Something that
  would provide entertainment for users while allowing me to experiment with new
  technologies. Typically, such a project would take me at least 2 days -
  design, implementation, testing, styling, deployment. But with the help of
  Claude Sonnet 4 AI agent, I completed it in just 2 hours.
</p>

<p>
  You can see the result at
  <a
    href="https://quizzy-eight-khaki.vercel.app/"
    target="_blank"
    rel="noopener"
    >quizzy-eight-khaki.vercel.app</a
  >. A fully functional quiz website with responsive design, various question
  categories, and a modern user interface.
</p>

<h2>What Changed in My Development Approach</h2>

<p>
  Traditionally, I would start by planning the architecture, sketching
  wireframes, writing basic HTML/CSS/JS structure, implementing quiz logic,
  fine-tuning styles, and finally deploying. Each step would require significant
  attention and debugging time.
</p>

<p>With the AI agent, the entire process was dramatically accelerated:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Instant structure generation</strong> - The agent designed the
    entire application architecture including components
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Automatic styling</strong> - Modern, responsive design was created
    within minutes
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Quiz logic</strong> - Implementation of scoring system, timer
    functions, and state management without manual coding
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Production optimization</strong> - Build process and Vercel
    deployment went smoothly
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Specific Benefits of AI in This Project</h2>

<h3>1. Speed of Iteration</h3>
<p>
  Instead of writing code line by line, I could communicate in natural language:
  "I want a quiz with a timer, different categories, and score tracking." The
  agent understood the requirements and implemented them within minutes.
</p>

<h3>2. Fewer Bugs</h3>
<p>
  The AI agent created clean, functional code with minimal bugs. No forgotten
  semicolons, no syntax errors, no responsiveness issues. The code was
  production-ready from the first run.
</p>

<h3>3. Modern Best Practices</h3>
<p>
  The agent automatically used modern approaches - semantic HTML, CSS
  Grid/Flexbox, vanilla JavaScript with modern syntax, proper file structure. I
  didn't have to think about the best implementation approach.
</p>

<h3>4. Focus on Creativity</h3>
<p>
  Instead of spending time on technical details, I could focus on user
  experience, question selection, and the overall concept of the application. AI
  handled the "boring" implementation part.
</p>

<h2>What AI Still Can't Handle</h2>

<p>
  To be fair to reality - AI isn't a magic wand. Even in this project, there
  were areas where I had to intervene:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Creative decisions</strong> - Final design choices, color schemes,
    and UX decisions
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Domain expertise</strong> - Selecting appropriate questions and
    balancing difficulty
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Strategic thinking</strong> - Deciding which features to implement
    and which to skip
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Edge case testing</strong> - Ensuring the application works in all
    browsers and situations
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Practical Impact on My Work</h2>

<p>
  This experience showed me how the programmer's role is changing. Instead of
  writing code, I'm becoming more of an architect and product manager. Instead
  of debugging syntax, I'm solving user needs and business logic.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Before:</strong> 70% coding time, 30% thinking time<br />
  <strong>Now:</strong> 30% coding time, 70% thinking and design time
</p>

<p>
  This shift allows me to complete more projects, experiment with new ideas, and
  focus more on the creative side of development.
</p>

<h2>Try the Quiz Yourself</h2>

<p>
  If you're curious about how such an AI-created project looks in practice, try
  <a
    href="https://quizzy-eight-khaki.vercel.app/"
    target="_blank"
    rel="noopener"
    >my quiz website</a
  >. It contains questions from various categories - from general knowledge to
  technology. You'll see that even though it was created in 2 hours, it provides
  a full-featured user experience.
</p>

<p>
  The website has everything you'd expect from a modern application: responsive
  design, smooth animations, state management, timer, scoring system. And most
  importantly - it's fun to use.
</p>

<h2>Conclusion: AI as a Creativity Accelerator</h2>

<p>
  AI didn't replace programming for me - it accelerated it to the point where I
  can focus on what I enjoy more. Instead of fighting with technicalities, I can
  concentrate on solving problems and creating useful applications.
</p>

<p>
  The era of spending hours tweaking CSS or debugging JavaScript is coming to an
  end. The future belongs to those who can effectively use AI as a tool for
  realizing their ideas.
</p>

<p>
  If you haven't started using AI tools in your development yet, I highly
  recommend it. The difference is truly dramatic - and as my quiz website shows,
  the results speak for themselves.
