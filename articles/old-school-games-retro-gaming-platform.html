<p>
  In an era where modern web development often means complex frameworks,
  countless dependencies, and client-side rendering, there's something
  refreshing about building a web application that stays true to the old-school
  approach. Today, I want to introduce you to
  <a href="https://oldschoolgames.eu/" target="_blank">Old School Games</a>, a
  retro gaming platform I've been developing that not only celebrates classic
  DOS games but also embraces the web technologies of yesteryear.
</p>

<h2>What is Old School Games?</h2>

<p>
  Old School Games is a web platform dedicated to preserving and making
  accessible the golden age of PC gaming. The site features a curated collection
  of classic DOS games from the 1980s and 1990s - titles like System Shock,
  Monkey Island, Civilization, Wolfenstein 3D, and many others. What makes it
  special is that all these games can be played directly in your browser without
  any downloads or complicated setup.
</p>

<p>
  The platform serves as a digital museum for gaming history, complete with
  detailed descriptions of each game, developer information, screenshots, and
  the ability to play these classics instantly. It's a nostalgic journey back to
  a time when games were crafted with heart and soul, featuring pixelated
  graphics, unforgettable soundtracks, and that unique atmosphere that defined
  an entire generation of gaming.
</p>

<h2>Technical Philosophy: Old School Web Development</h2>

<p>
  What's particularly interesting about Old School Games is that it doesn't just
  celebrate retro gaming - it's built using a retro web development approach. In
  keeping with the philosophy of simplicity and staying true to the era it
  represents, the entire platform is built with traditional server-side
  technologies:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Node.js and Express</strong> - For the backend server and routing
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>PostgreSQL</strong> - Direct database queries without ORM overhead
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>EJS templating</strong> - Server-side rendering for fast,
    SEO-friendly pages
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Minimal client-side JavaScript</strong> - Just enough for essential
    interactions
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  This approach mirrors how websites were built in the 1990s and early 2000s -
  predominantly server-side rendered with minimal client-side JavaScript. It's a
  deliberate choice that aligns with the platform's mission to preserve and
  honor the past.
</p>

<h2>Why Server-Side Rendering Still Matters</h2>

<p>
  In today's JavaScript-heavy web development landscape, Old School Games
  demonstrates that server-side rendering (SSR) still has significant
  advantages:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>SEO Benefits</strong> - Pages are fully rendered on the server,
    making them easily indexable by search engines
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Performance</strong> - Fast initial page loads without waiting for
    JavaScript bundles
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Accessibility</strong> - Works perfectly even with JavaScript
    disabled
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Simplicity</strong> - No complex build processes or state management
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  The result is a website that loads quickly, works reliably, and provides an
  excellent user experience across all devices and browsers - much like the
  robust, dependable games it hosts.
</p>

<h2>Game Collection and Features</h2>

<p>
  Old School Games features an impressive collection spanning multiple genres:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Strategy Games</strong> - Civilization, Dune II, Transport Tycoon
    Deluxe
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Adventure Games</strong> - Monkey Island series, Indiana Jones and
    the Fate of Atlantis
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Action Games</strong> - Duke Nukem 3D, Wolfenstein 3D, Doom II
  </li>
  <li><strong>RPGs</strong> - System Shock, Lands of Lore, Ishar series</li>
  <li><strong>Simulation Games</strong> - SimCity, Star Wars: TIE Fighter</li>
</ul>

<p>The platform includes useful features like:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Alphabetical browsing and genre-based filtering</li>
  <li>Developer and publisher information</li>
  <li>Release year organization</li>
  <li>Game of the Week highlights</li>
  <li>Recently added games section</li>
</ul>

<h2>Technical Implementation Highlights</h2>

<p>
  Building a retro gaming platform presents unique technical challenges. The
  games run using DOSBox compiled to WebAssembly, allowing classic DOS
  executables to run in modern browsers. This requires careful optimization to
  ensure good performance while maintaining compatibility across different
  browsers and devices.
</p>

<p>
  The database structure is designed to efficiently handle game metadata, user
  preferences, and game states. Using PostgreSQL with direct SQL queries (no
  ORM) provides maximum control over database performance and allows for complex
  queries needed for filtering and searching the game collection.
</p>

<h2>The Future of Retro Gaming</h2>

<p>
  Old School Games represents more than just a gaming platform - it's a
  preservation project. As we move further into the future, these classic games
  risk being forgotten or becoming inaccessible due to hardware and software
  obsolescence. By making them available in modern browsers, we ensure that
  future generations can experience the games that shaped the industry.
</p>

<p>
  The platform continues to grow, with new games being added regularly. The
  focus remains on quality over quantity - each game is carefully selected for
  its historical significance and gameplay value.
</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>
  Old School Games proves that sometimes the best approach is to keep things
  simple. By using traditional web technologies and server-side rendering, the
  platform delivers a fast, reliable, and accessible experience that honors both
  the games it hosts and the web development practices of the era.
</p>

<p>
  Whether you're a gaming enthusiast looking to relive childhood memories, a
  developer interested in retro gaming preservation, or someone curious about
  classic game design, Old School Games offers a unique window into the golden
  age of PC gaming.
